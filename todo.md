- Update game over/win window: clear terminal window, but reprint
  the word length, and letters guessed
- Remove "correct guesses" from status screen
- Format printing of "letters guessed"
- Create/incorporate user object
- Create/incorporate main controller object
- Allow people to guess the word outright??? (this seems to be in a lot of peoples' games. I'm not sure I'm sold though
- Add a "reload" method to the console, so we can reload the environment instead of exiting pry (see code challenge)
